# Multi-UAV Motion Planning using GAIL

This project demonstrates how to train multiple UAVs to navigate in a shared space with dynamic and static obstacles using GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning). 

Key Components:
- Expert trajectory generation using Velocity Obstacle
- Multi-agent environment simulated using AirSim-compatible format
- GAIL-based policy training
